# .BSS Sigma

The `.BSS` segment in programming refers to the Block Started by Symbol, which is used to allocate memory for uninitialized global and static variables. In Flutter, this concept is not directly applicable but can be understood in the context of memory management and optimization.

## Key Points:
- `.BSS` is a memory segment for uninitialized variables.
- It helps reduce the size of the executable by not storing zero-initialized data.
- In Dart, memory management is abstracted, but understanding `.BSS` can help in optimizing native integrations.

### Example:
```c
// Example in C
int globalVar; // Stored in .BSS
```
